# Infographics: Christmas Trees

Did you know that you need to utilize an artificial tree for at least 12 years for the emissions of manufacturing and transporting it to equal that of a responsibly disposed of real tree?
 
However, the method of disposal is also important to consider when purchasing a real tree for Christmas - Almost 4.5 times more carbon dioxide is released when a tree is sent to landfill than if it is chipped or recycled. Also, as the tree decomposes it produces methane gas, which is 25 times more potent as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide.
 
So, if you donâ€™t dispose of the real tree properly, you may be better off getting a good quality artificial tree, as the impact to the environment would be the same after only 3 years. Whilst burning the tree emits the carbon dioxide that it stored up when it was growing, so there is no net increase.
 
I started this project wanting to focus on improving my graphic design skills by creating a super quick infographic but ended up learning a lot about the history and environmental impact of Christmas trees.
